🥗 NutriFlow

NutriFlow is a multiplatform application (Web and Mobile) currently under active development, designed to improve how people plan their meals, manage ingredients, and reduce food waste.

By leveraging Artificial Intelligence, the platform aims to bridge the gap between available ingredients and personalized nutrition, promoting conscious, efficient, and sustainable eating habits.

🚧 Project Status

Active Development

The project is currently focused on backend foundation and architecture, with particular attention to:

Clean and modular architecture

Secure authentication and authorization

JWT-based access control

Data validation and API consistency

Best practices with NestJS and Prisma ORM

Advanced features such as AI-driven recipe generation and frontend consumption will be integrated progressively.

🎯 Project Vision

NutriFlow is not intended to be just another recipe application. Its goal is to become an intelligent nutrition assistant, capable of adapting to the user’s real-life context while encouraging sustainability and reducing unnecessary food waste.
