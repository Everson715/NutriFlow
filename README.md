# 🥗 NutriFlow

**NutriFlow** is a multiplatform application (Web and Mobile) currently under active development, designed to improve how people plan their meals, manage ingredients, and reduce food waste.

By leveraging **Artificial Intelligence**, the platform aims to bridge the gap between available ingredients and personalized nutrition, promoting conscious, efficient, and sustainable eating habits.

## 🚧 Project Status

> **Active Development**

The project is currently focused on **backend foundation and architecture**, with particular attention to:

- Clean and modular architecture  
- Secure authentication and authorization  
- JWT-based access control  
- Data validation and API consistency  
- Best practices with NestJS and Prisma ORM  

Advanced features such as AI-driven recipe generation and frontend consumption will be integrated progressively.
