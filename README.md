# 🥗 NutriFlow

**NutriFlow** is a multiplatform application (Web and Mobile) currently under active development, designed to improve how people plan their meals, manage ingredients, and reduce food waste.

By leveraging **Artificial Intelligence**, the platform aims to bridge the gap between available ingredients and personalized nutrition, promoting conscious, efficient, and sustainable eating habits.

----------

## 🚧 Project Status

> **Active Development**

The project is currently focused on **backend foundation and architecture**, with particular attention to:

-   Clean and modular architecture
    
-   Secure authentication and authorization
    
-   JWT-based access control
    
-   Data validation and API consistency
    
-   Best practices with NestJS and Prisma ORM
    

Advanced features such as AI-driven recipe generation and frontend consumption will be integrated progressively.

----------

## 🎯 Project Vision

NutriFlow is not intended to be just another recipe application. Its goal is to become an **intelligent nutrition assistant**, capable of adapting to the user’s real-life context while encouraging sustainability and reducing unnecessary food waste.

----------

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security _(in progress)_

-   User registration and login
    
-   JWT-based authentication
    
-   Token validation endpoint (`/auth/validate`)
    
-   Protected routes with Guards and middleware
    

### 🍽️ Smart Recipe Generation _(planned)_

-   AI-powered recipe suggestions based on available ingredients
    
-   Intelligent ingredient substitutions
    
-   Adaptation to dietary restrictions and preferences
    

### 📊 Nutrition & Consumption Management _(planned)_

-   Automatic nutritional calculations
    
-   Ingredient usage tracking
    
-   Reports to support conscious consumption
